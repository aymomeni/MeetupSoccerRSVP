# Meetup Soccer RSVP
* A simple java project that that RSVPs soccer players to a local Soccer Meetup group
* Restful Services to communicate with Meetup.com
* TimerTask to setup RSVP scheduling
* JSON parsing

## What makes this undetectable from the perspective of Meetup Organizers?
* Player (api key) collections are shuffled before rsvps
* Weekday games have a slight random delay (couple minutes) that make the rsvp process seam like a conventional client side rsvp mechanism


> This project is running on a Raspberry Pi terminal and is an easy cheap alternative to manual rsvping using annoying reminders
